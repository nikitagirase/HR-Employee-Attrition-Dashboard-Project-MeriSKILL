# HR-Employee-Attrition-Dashboard-Project-MeriSKILL

## Problem Statement:
 Build a HR dashboard to track and analyze attrition in an organization
### Goal:
The goal of this project on HR analytics is to give HR managers and corporate executives a thorough method to track, analyze, and make decisions about hiring, development, and retention of employees based on data.


Great opportunity to dive into the world of HR analytics to make data driven decision making. I have developed an interactive Power Bi dashboard that offers insightful information about staff data.
I cleaned and visualized the data using Power BI's capabilities. The outcome was a plethora of knowledge about employee attrition.
